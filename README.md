# SMKDEV_ADVANCE_CHALLENGES
 The Advance Challenge on SMKDEV website could solve with 3 different ways, on this repository
 I have Uploaded 3 different solutions in 3 Different files.
 There is 3 Solution
 1. Solution 1 is the most simple solution that only run the program without any validation about the user input
 2. Solution 2 is also the simple one but I add some simple code to validate user input and when the user input the wrong Input then the program will telling the user that they are input the wrong input
 3. Solution 3 is contain the do while loop and also the validation of the user input, when the user input a wrong input the program will tell the user that they input the wrong input and the program will rerun and ask the user to input another input.

# PLEASE CHECK THE SOLUTION 3 FOR MORE COMPLEX SOLUTION BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE SIMPLE WAYS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM FEEL FREE TO CHECK THE SOLUTION 1 AND 2
